      "iodine bought this based on early 's convinced reviews , but i do not portion those like convinced opinions at all . either they are all dyson employees or i received a faulty product.1 . atrocious sucking . especially atrocious with cat hair's-breadth . iodine do n't understand how these others say differently . my older eureka foreman was substantially best ( and substantially cheap ) . it just passed over the cat hair's-breadth on the sofa without pulling it up . at 1st iodine thought maybe the roll was n't rolled , but it was . it just did n't work well at all . on low carpets it got items on the Earth's_surface ( little bits of bric-a-brac ) but absolutely no sucking on the rug ( neither rug nor barefloor modes ) . did n't even leave vacuity marks.2 . the least small matter caused the chief roll to make a very brassy `` admonition '' auditory_sensation . one read in the instructions that this admonition auditory_sensation is to alert the exploiter that something is stuck in the roll which is causing it to not roll at peak efficiency . it `` warned '' me off and on during my full vacuity school_term . iodine kept checking the roll and nil was impeding the roll . one 'd clear out a small part of bagatelle and try again . it is the loud , most objectionable auditory_sensation you 'll ever hear.3 . one convinced matter iodine want to mention : the easiness of emptying the dust pail was outstanding ( after figuring it out ) . however , this characteristic was not deserving $ 500.00 ... but should still get a mention.4 . to use the hose propagation , it requires jumping through more_than hoops than any early vacuity iodine 've ever owned . it was the hapless designing iodine 've ever run across.i had some friends come over to see if they could get it to work best than me . i 'm not above making errors and thought perhaps one put it together incorrectly or was using it incorrectly . after about half an hr of checking and testing everything , they concurred that it was a part of feces and were in arrant daze that iodine paid half a expansive for it . it 's now a running gag between us and we make certain we tell everyone we meet about this atrocious merchandise .\n",
